        <h2>Mathematical formulas</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form
        </p>
        <p class="formula">ax+b-0</p>
        <p>where <span class="leter">a</span> and <span class="leter">b</span> are real numbers and <span
                class="leter">x</span> is a
            variable. This form is
            sometimes called the
            standard form of a
            linear equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or
            may not be anx so don't get too locked into always seeing an <span class="leter">x</span> there</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
        </p>
        <p class="formula">ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</p>
        <p>where <span class="leter">a</span>,<span class="leter">b</span>,<span class="leter">c</span> are known values
            and x is the
            variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also,<span class="leter">a</span> can't be 0</p>
        <h3>The area of a circle (A)</h3>
        <p> <span class="leter">π</span> (PI) times the radius(<span class="leter">r</span>) squared</p>
        <p class="formula">A = π x r<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>or when you know the diameter (<span class="leter">D</span>)</p>
        <p class="formula">A = (π/4) x D<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>or when you know the circumference (<span class="leter">C</span>)</p>
        <p class="formula">A = C<sup>2</sup>/4 x π</p>
        <h3>Intersection</h3>
        <p>The intersection of two sets<span class="leter">A</span> and <span class="leter">B</span> denoted by A
            <span>&#8745;</span> B is the set of all objects that are
            members of both the
            sets A and B, in symbols
        </p>
        <p class="formula">A
            <span>&#8745;</span> B = {x:x <span>&#8712</span> A and x <span>&#8712</span> B}
        <p>That is, <span class="leter">x</span> an element of the intersection A
            <span>&#8745;</span> B if and only if <span class="leter">x</span> is both an element of <span
                class="leter">A</span> and an element of
            <span class="leter">B</span>
        </p>
        </p>
